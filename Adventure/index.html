        <dd style="font-family:Verdana">Walk into the canyon<br>September 2, 1999<br><br>On the Second day, we hiked down into the inside of the canyon. It is way to hot and we underestimated the amount of water we would need. We walked around in the canyon for a while, but we ran out of water about 1/3 of the way back. When we finally got back we refilled all our water bottle and drank away. We were exhausted from walking around all day in the head and rested before we left the shade.</dd>

        IMAGE
        <dd style="font-family:Verdana">Visited an Archeology center<br>September 3, 1999<br><br>We went back down into the canyon the next day, we brought a lot more water, which was actually quite heavy. Who knew water could be so heavy. We hiked back down to the inside of the canyon, luckly the archeology center was right at the bottom. There they showed us some of the bones and fossiles they have found still in the rock. We probally brought to much water and it was hard to hike back up.</dd>
