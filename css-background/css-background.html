    <div id="style1">Tigers are magnificent and powerful big cats, known for their striking orange coats adorned with black stripes. Native to various parts of Asia, including forests, grasslands, and mangrove swamps, these solitary hunters are the largest members of the cat family. Tigers are remarkable for their strength and agility, often stalking their prey with stealth before launching a powerful chase.

        Each tiger has a unique pattern of stripes, much like a human fingerprint, which helps researchers identify individual animals. They are primarily carnivorous, preying on large ungulates like deer and wild boar, but they can adapt their diet based on the availability of food. Tigers are also known for their incredible swimming ability, often cooling off in water or pursuing prey in rivers and lakes.
        
        Sadly, tigers face numerous threats, including habitat loss, poaching, and the illegal wildlife trade. Conservation efforts are crucial for their survival, with various organizations working to protect their natural habitats and combat poaching. In many cultures, tigers are symbols of strength and courage, often appearing in folklore and art. Their beauty and majesty make them one of the most iconic animals on the planet, capturing the hearts of people worldwide.
